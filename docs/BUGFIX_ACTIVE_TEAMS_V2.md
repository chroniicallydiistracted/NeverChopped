# 🐛 BUG FIX: Active Teams Detection & Eliminated Teams Display

## **Date:** October 16, 2025

---

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

### **Issue #1: Showing All 18 Teams Instead of 12 Active**
- The Sleeper API returns matchups for **ALL teams** (including eliminated ones)
- `matchups.length` was 18, not 12
- The app couldn't distinguish between active and eliminated teams

### **Issue #2: No Visibility Into Eliminated Teams**
- Users couldn't see **which teams** were eliminated
- No way to verify the detection logic was working correctly
- Confusion about whether the count was accurate

---

## 💡 **Root Cause Analysis**

The Sleeper Fantasy Football API doesn't provide an `eliminated` flag or status. When teams get "chopped" in a survival league:
- They still appear in the `rosters` endpoint
- They still appear in the `matchups` endpoint (with 0 points)
- **No explicit API field indicates elimination**

**Challenge:** How to detect eliminated teams **BEFORE games start** (when points = 0)?

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented: 3-Tier Smart Detection**

### **Tier 1: Manual Override** (User Control)
- Added `teamsRemaining` to config
- User can manually set: "12 teams remaining"
- Overrides all auto-detection
- **Use case:** Most accurate when user updates weekly

### **Tier 2: Historical Analysis** (Automated)
- Fetches the **last 3 weeks** of matchup data
- Tracks each team's point history
- **Detection Rule:** If a team scored 0 points for **2+ consecutive weeks** → Eliminated
- Works **before current week starts** (uses historical data)
- **Example:**
  ```
  Team #5: [0, 0, 0] → Eliminated
  Team #8: [89.5, 0, 0] → Eliminated
  Team #12: [102.3, 0, 95.6] → Active (played Week 3)
  ```

### **Tier 3: Fallback** (Safety Net)
- If detection fails, uses total roster count
- Shows warning in console
- Prompts user to set manual config

---

## 🛠️ **Code Changes**

### **1. New State Variables**
```tsx
const [activeTeamsCount, setActiveTeamsCount] = useState<number | null>(null);
const [eliminatedTeams, setEliminatedTeams] = useState<number[]>([]); // NEW!
```

### **2. Smart Detection Function**
```tsx
const calculateActiveTeams = async (
  nflStateData: any, 
  rostersData: any[]
): Promise<{ count: number, eliminated: number[] }> => {
  // Returns both count AND list of eliminated roster IDs
}
```

### **3. Updated Survival Mode UI**

#### **Filter Active Teams Only**
```tsx
{survivalAnalysis.scores
  .filter(score => !eliminatedTeams.includes(score.rosterId)) // NEW!
  .map((score, idx) => {
    // Show only active teams (12)
  })
}
```

#### **New Section: Eliminated Teams Display**
```tsx
{eliminatedTeams.length > 0 && (
  <div className="bg-red-500/10 border border-red-500/30">
    <h3>🪦 CHOPPED - Eliminated Teams ({eliminatedTeams.length})</h3>
    {/* Shows team name, record, and skull emoji */}
  </div>
)}
```

## 📊 **What You'll See Now**

### **Before Fix:**
```
📊 You're 9 of 18. 0.00 points above elimination.
[Shows all 18 teams in scoreboard]
```

### **After Fix:**
```
📊 You're 9 of 12. 15.3 points above elimination.

🏈 12 Teams Alive (Ranked Best to Worst)
   6 Already Eliminated

[Shows only 12 active teams]

🪦 CHOPPED - Eliminated Teams (6)
[Shows 6 eliminated teams with records]
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

1. **Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Open Console** (F12)
3. **Navigate to Survival Mode tab**
4. **Look for console logs:**
   ```
   🔍 Historical detection: 12 active teams (eliminated: [3, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18])
   ```
5. **Verify UI shows:**
   - "12 Teams Alive" (not 18)
   - Scoreboard with only 12 teams
   - "CHOPPED" section with 6 eliminated teams

---

## ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

### **Option A: Use Auto-Detection (Default)**
- Just refresh the app
- Historical analysis runs automatically
- Works for Week 3+ of the season

### **Option B: Manual Override**
Edit `src/config.ts`:
```typescript
export const defaultConfig = {
  userId: 'your_user_id',
  leagueId: 'your_league_id',
  username: 'Your Name',
  teamsRemaining: 12 // ADD THIS LINE
};
```

---

## 🎯 **Benefits**

✅ **Accurate team counts** before games start  
✅ **Visual confirmation** of eliminated teams  
✅ **Works week-to-week** without manual updates (if using auto-detection)  
✅ **Flexible** - can use auto or manual mode  
✅ **Transparent** - shows which teams are eliminated and why

---

## 📝 **Technical Notes**

### **Why 2+ Consecutive Weeks of 0 Points?**
- **1 week of 0:** Could be a bye week or incomplete lineup
- **2+ weeks of 0:** Almost certainly eliminated (no roster activity)

### **Why Check Last 3 Weeks?**
- Balances accuracy vs API calls
- Recent enough to catch new eliminations
- Far enough back to establish patterns

### **Edge Cases Handled:**
- ✅ Week 1-2 of season (falls back to roster count)
- ✅ API failures (falls back gracefully)
- ✅ Manual override (always takes precedence)
- ✅ Eliminated teams with bench points (checks starter points only)

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Users**

1. **Verify Accuracy:** Check that the 6 eliminated teams shown match reality
2. **Optional:** Add `teamsRemaining: 12` to config for guaranteed accuracy
3. **Each Week:** Auto-detection will update as teams get chopped
4. **Update Manual Config:** If using manual mode, update the number weekly

**✨ Your survival mode is now accurately tracking active teams!**
