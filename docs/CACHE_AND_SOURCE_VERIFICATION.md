# 🔍 Cache and Source Verification

## Question: "Is there a different folder where code is being served?"

**Answer**: No, but I found important information.

## File Structure Analysis

### ✅ Correct Source Files (ACTIVE)
These are the files being served by Vite in dev mode:

```
/home/andre/NeverChopped/
├── index.html                                    ← Entry point
├── src/
│   ├── main.tsx                                  ← React entry
│   ├── App.tsx                                   ← Renders SleeperFFHelper
│   └── components/
│       ├── SleeperFFHelper.tsx                   ← 2869 lines (ACTIVE)
│       └── LiveGameVisualizer.tsx                ← 1578 lines (ACTIVE, with debug logs)
```

### ⚠️ Old/Duplicate Files (IGNORED)
These files exist but are NOT being used:

```
/home/andre/NeverChopped/
├── sleeper_ff_helper.tsx                         ← 1166 lines (OLD, not imported anywhere)
└── sleeper-draft-board.tsx                       ← (OLD, not imported anywhere)
```

## Vite Configuration

**Serving from**: `/home/andre/NeverChopped/src/`  
**No build folder**: Running in dev mode (no `dist/` folder)  
**Port**: 3000  
**HMR enabled**: Via `sleeper.westfam.media:3000`

## Import Chain Verification

```
index.html
  → /src/main.tsx
    → /src/App.tsx
      → /src/components/SleeperFFHelper.tsx
        → /src/components/LiveGameVisualizer.tsx ✅
```

**Confirmed**: The file with debug logs (`src/components/LiveGameVisualizer.tsx`) IS the one being served.

## Possible Cache Issues

Even though the correct file is being served, the browser might be caching old JavaScript. Here's what to try:

### Hard Refresh (Clear Cache & Reload)

**Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`  
**Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Disable Cache in DevTools

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Open Settings (F1 or gear icon)
3. Under "Network", check **"Disable cache (while DevTools is open)"**
4. Keep DevTools open while testing

### Manual Cache Clear

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the **Refresh button** next to address bar
3. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

### Nuclear Option - Clear All Browser Data

1. DevTools → Application tab → Storage
2. Click **"Clear site data"**
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Verify Vite is Serving Updated Files

Check the terminal where `./dev.sh` is running. When you save a file, you should see:

```
hmr update /src/components/LiveGameVisualizer.tsx (x1)
```

If you DON'T see HMR updates when you save files, the dev server might be stale.

## HMR (Hot Module Replacement) Verification

### Test if HMR is Working:

1. Open `src/components/LiveGameVisualizer.tsx`
2. Find line ~1230 (where player name is rendered)
3. Change:
   ```tsx
   {player.name}
   ```
   to:
   ```tsx
   {player.name} TEST
   ```
4. Save the file
5. Check terminal for: `hmr update /src/components/LiveGameVisualizer.tsx`
6. Check browser - should update instantly WITHOUT full page reload
7. If it updates, HMR is working
8. Change it back to `{player.name}`

## Timestamp Verification

Run this command to see when files were last modified:

```bash
ls -lh /home/andre/NeverChopped/src/components/LiveGameVisualizer.tsx
ls -lh /home/andre/NeverChopped/src/lib/play-data/adapters/espn-adapter.ts
```

Should show today's date (October 19, 2025).

## Summary

✅ **Correct files are being served** from `/home/andre/NeverChopped/src/`  
✅ **Debug logging is in the active files**  
✅ **No build/dist folder interfering**  
⚠️ **Browser cache** might be serving old JavaScript  
⚠️ **HMR** might not be updating the browser

## Next Steps

1. **Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Open DevTools console** (F12)
3. **Navigate to Live Game tab**
4. **Select a game**
5. **Look for 🔍 debug messages** in console

If you STILL don't see debug messages after hard refresh, the issue is that:
- Either the browser is REALLY aggressively caching
- Or the dev server isn't running the latest code
- Or there's a bundling issue

Let me know what you see in the console after a hard refresh!
