# üöÄ Major Feature Implementations - Session Complete

## **Date:** October 16, 2025
## **Status:** ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS**

### **1. Player Projections Integration** ‚úÖ
**What was added:**
- Integrated Sleeper's projections API (`/v1/projections/nfl/{season}/{week}`)
- Fetches projected points for all players each week
- Automatically switches between actual scores and projections

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Fetches projections on data load
const projectionsRes = await fetch(`https://api.sleeper.app/v1/projections/nfl/${season}/${week}`);

// Calculates team projected scores
projectedScores = rosters.map(roster => {
  let projectedPoints = 0;
  roster.starters.forEach(playerId => {
    projectedPoints += projections[playerId]?.stats?.pts_half_ppr || 0;
  });
  return { rosterId, points: projectedPoints, isProjected: true };
});

// Uses projections if games haven't started (actual scores = 0)
const displayScores = hasProjections && actualScores[0].points === 0 
  ? projectedScores 
  : actualScores;
```

**Benefits:**
‚úÖ **Pre-Game Rankings** - See where you'll likely rank before games start
‚úÖ **Better Risk Assessment** - Know elimination danger earlier
‚úÖ **Smart UI** - Shows "üîÆ PROJECTED" badge when using projections
‚úÖ **Automatic Switching** - Switches to actual scores once games begin

**UI Changes:**
- Survival Mode scoreboard shows projected rankings before games
- "PROJECTED" badge appears in header
- Console log shows how many player projections loaded
- Rankings update automatically as games progress

---

### **2. Enhanced Lineup Alerts** ‚úÖ
**What was added:**
- Projection-based recommendations
- Bench vs starter comparison
- Reasoning and confidence scores
- Alternative player suggestions

**Alert Types:**

#### **CRITICAL: Injury Alerts**
```
üö® Player X (RB) is Out
Action: MUST SIT
Projected: 0.0 pts
Reasoning: Will score 0 if inactive
Alternative: Consider Player Y (proj: 12.3 pts)
Confidence: 100%
```

#### **CRITICAL: Inactive/IR**
```
üö® Player X (WR) is Injured Reserve  
Action: BENCH IMMEDIATELY
Projected: 0.0 pts
Reasoning: Injured Reserve - will score 0 points this week
Confidence: 100%
```

#### **WARNING: Low Projection**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Player X (TE) has very low projection
Action: CONSIDER BENCHING
Projected: 3.2 pts
Reasoning: Projected only 3.2 pts - tough matchup or reduced role expected
Confidence: 70%
```

#### **INFO: Better Bench Option**
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Player Y projected higher than starter
Action: START OVER Player X
Projected: 15.8 pts
Reasoning: Player Y: 15.8 pts vs Player X: 12.3 pts (3.5 pt advantage)
Confidence: 65%
```

**Algorithm:**
1. **Scans all starters** for injuries, inactive status, low projections
2. **Compares bench players** to starters at same position
3. **Calculates projection differentials** (must be 3+ pts higher to recommend)
4. **Finds alternatives** - suggests best bench option for injured players
5. **Sorts by severity** - CRITICAL ‚Üí WARNING ‚Üí INFO

**Benefits:**
‚úÖ **Proactive Alerts** - Warns about low projections, not just injuries
‚úÖ **Data-Driven** - Uses actual projections, not guesses
‚úÖ **Actionable** - Tells you exactly what to do
‚úÖ **Context-Rich** - Explains WHY with confidence scores
‚úÖ **Alternatives Provided** - Suggests specific replacements

## üìä **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **API Endpoints Used:**
```
GET https://api.sleeper.app/v1/projections/nfl/{season}/{week}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "player_id": "4984",
    "stats": {
      "pts_half_ppr": 18.5,
      "pts_ppr": 20.2,
      "rush_yd": 75,
      "rec": 4,
      "rec_yd": 35
    }
  }
]
```

### **Data Flow:**
```
1. fetchAllData() runs on page load
2. Fetches projections from Sleeper API
3. Converts array to object map (player_id ‚Üí projection)
4. Stores in projections state
5. getSurvivalAnalysis() calculates team projected scores
6. getStartSitRecommendations() uses projections for alerts
7. UI displays projected scores if games haven't started
8. Auto-switches to actual scores once games begin
```

### **State Management:**
```typescript
const [projections, setProjections] = useState<any>({}); // Player proj map
const [survivalAnalysis.isUsingProjections] = useState(boolean); // UI flag
const [survivalAnalysis.myProjectedScore] = useState(number); // My proj
```

## üéØ **REMAINING TODO ITEMS**

### **#3: Deep Analytics Reasoning** (Not Started)
**Goal:** Add explanations to Deep Analytics recommendations
**Requirements:**
- Why is player flagged as "sleeper"?
- What data supports rookie standout identification?
- How are defense matchups calculated?
- Show confidence scores for each recommendation

### **#4: Tighten Waiver Wire** (Not Started)
**Goal:** Add more context to waiver recommendations
**Requirements:**
- Opportunity share percentage
- Target trends (last 3 games)
- Snap count percentages
- Recent performance metrics
- Injury replacement context

### **#5: Quick Action Links** (Not Started)
**Goal:** Add interactive elements to recommendations
**Requirements:**
- Weather forecast links (OpenWeather API)
- "Add to Waiver" buttons
- "Replace Player" quick actions
- News links for each player
- One-click lineup changes

## üß™ **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Test Projections:**
1. Refresh page before any NFL games start
2. Go to Survival Mode tab
3. Look for:
   - üîÆ icon in header
   - "PROJECTED" badge
   - Console: "üìä Loaded projections for X players"
   - Scoreboard showing projected points
4. After games start, verify it switches to actual scores

### **Test Enhanced Lineup Alerts:**
1. Go to Dashboard tab
2. Check "Lineup Alerts" section
3. Verify you see:
   - Injury alerts with projected points
   - "Reasoning:" field explaining the alert
   - "Alternative:" suggestions for injured players
   - "Confidence:" percentage scores
4. Look for "Better Bench Option" alerts if you have high-projected bench players

### **Console Logs to Check:**
```
üìä Loaded projections for 450 players
üîç SURVIVAL DEBUG: { isUsingProjections: true, myProjectedScore: 125.3, ... }
```
