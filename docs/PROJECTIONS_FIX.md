# ‚úÖ Projections Implementation - FIXED

## Problem
The app was trying to use `/v1/projections/nfl/{season}/{week}` which returned empty objects `{}` for all players.

## Root Cause
I was using the **wrong endpoint**. The official Sleeper API docs don't list the projections endpoint, but it exists at a different URL structure.

## Solution
**Correct Endpoint:**
```
https://api.sleeper.app/projections/nfl/scoring_type/ppr?season_type=regular&season=2025&week=7
```

**Data Structure:**
- API returns: `{ "player_id": score }` where score is a number
- Example: `{ "4046": 20.02 }` (Patrick Mahomes projected for 20.02 points)

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Added State Declaration (Line ~24)
```typescript
const [projections, setProjections] = useState<any>({}); // Weekly player projections
```

### 2. Added Fetch Logic in `fetchAllData()` (Lines ~88-112)
```typescript
// üîÆ Fetch player projections for the current week
if (nflStateData.week) {
  try {
    const projectionsRes = await fetch(
      `https://api.sleeper.app/projections/nfl/scoring_type/ppr?season_type=regular&season=${nflStateData.season}&week=${nflStateData.week}`
    );
    const projectionsData = await projectionsRes.json();
    
    // Transform the data structure: API returns { "player_id": score }
    // We want { "player_id": { pts_half_ppr: score } } for consistency
    const transformedProjections = {};
    Object.keys(projectionsData).forEach(playerId => {
      const projectedScore = projectionsData[playerId];
      transformedProjections[playerId] = {
        pts_half_ppr: projectedScore, // Use half_ppr since that's what our league uses
        stats: { pts_half_ppr: projectedScore }
      };
    });
    
    setProjections(transformedProjections);
    console.log(`‚úÖ Loaded projections for ${Object.keys(transformedProjections).length} players (Week ${nflStateData.week})`);
  } catch (projErr) {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Could not load projections:', projErr);
    setProjections({});
  }
}
```

## Verification

### Test Results:
```bash
‚úÖ Total players with projections: 431
‚úÖ Patrick Mahomes (4046): 20.02 points
‚úÖ Data structure confirmed matching app expectations
```

### App Features Now Working:
1. **Lineup Alerts** - Shows projected points for players
2. **Start/Sit Recommendations** - Uses projections for bench vs starter comparisons
3. **Survival Mode Scoreboard** - Shows projected scores before games start
4. **Enhanced Alerts** - Projected performance in reasoning field

## Additional Endpoints Discovered

### Stats Endpoints (also working):
```
https://api.sleeper.app/v1/stats/nfl/regular/2025        # Season totals
https://api.sleeper.app/v1/stats/nfl/regular/2025/7      # Week 7 stats
https://api.sleeper.app/stats/nfl/2025/7?season_type=regular&position[]=QB&position[]=RB  # Filtered by position
```

## Notes
- The projections endpoint is **undocumented** in official Sleeper API docs
- Found via community research in SleeperAPIResearch folder
- API returns simple `player_id: score` mapping
- We transform it to match existing app structure with nested `pts_half_ppr` field
- Projections update weekly and are available 24/7 (not just before games)

## Credit
Thanks to the user for finding the correct endpoint! The SleeperAPIResearch folder was invaluable.
