# Important: Sleeper Projections Are NOT Available via Public API

## The Situation

After thorough investigation of Sleeper's API documentation and testing multiple endpoints:

**CONFIRMED**: Sleeper does NOT expose fantasy projections through their public read-only API.

### What I Checked:
1. ‚úÖ `/v1/players/nfl` - Has player info, status, injuries (NO projections)
2. ‚úÖ `/v1/league/{id}/matchups/{week}` - Has actual points scored (NO projections)
3. ‚úÖ `/v1/league/{id}/rosters` - Has roster data, totals (NO projections)
4. ‚ùå `/v1/projections/nfl/{season}/{week}` - Does NOT exist
5. ‚ùå `/v1/stats/*` - No stats endpoints exist
6. ‚ùå No projection fields in any player data

### What Sleeper Shows in Their App
You're correct that Sleeper's app displays projections 24/7. However:
- These projections are calculated/purchased INTERNALLY by Sleeper
- They use PRIVATE APIs that aren't documented or accessible
- Their public API is intentionally read-only and limited

##  What Your App NEEDS

Since projections aren't available, we have two paths forward:

### Option 1: Work Without Projections (Recommended for now)
Your app already has EXCELLENT features that work perfectly:

**Currently Working:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time injury alerts (Active/Inactive/IR status)
- ‚úÖ Historical performance analysis (season averages)
- ‚úÖ Bench vs starter comparisons (based on actual PPG)
- ‚úÖ Survival mode tracking with live scores
- ‚úÖ Elimination risk assessment
- ‚úÖ Points left on bench calculations

**How Alerts Work Without Projections:**
- CRITICAL: Injured/Inactive players in lineup
- WARNING: Bench players averaging more PPG than starters  
- INFO: Position depth and waiver opportunities

**Example Alert (Historical-Based):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Consider benching Jaylen Warren (RB)

Warren: 4.2 PPG average this season (7 games)
Bench RB McKinnon: 6.8 PPG average (6 games)

üí° McKinnon has been 2.6 points better per game this season
Confidence: 70% (based on sample size)
```

### Option 2: Integrate Third-Party Projections
If you want pre-game projections, you would need:

**Free Options:**
- ESPN API (requires scraping, unofficial)
- Yahoo API (limited, requires OAuth)
- FantasyPros (free tier has limits)

**Paid Options:**
- FantasyData API ($$ - most reliable)
- SportsData.io ($$$)
- RapidAPI Fantasy Sports ($ - varies)

**Effort Required:**
- New API integration (2-4 hours)
- Data mapping (Sleeper IDs ‚Üí Their IDs)
- Weekly API calls management
- Potential cost

## üìä Recommendation

**Keep your app as-is for now** because:

1. **It's fully functional** with real Sleeper data
2. **Historical averages** are often MORE reliable than projections
3. **Injury/status alerts** are the most critical feature anyway
4. **No additional costs** or API management needed
5. **Simpler maintenance**

Your app provides:
- Real injury intelligence
- Proven performance data
- Live game tracking  
- Survival mode analysis

These are the features that actually WIN fantasy leagues!

## üéØ Next Steps

**Choose Your Path:**

**A) Stay with current approach** (Recommended)
- Remove projection UI elements
- Keep historical-based alerts
- Focus on injury/status intelligence
- App remains fully functional

**B) Add third-party projections**
- Choose a projection provider
- Integrate their API
- Map player IDs
- Manage API limits/costs

Let me know which direction you want to go and I'll implement it!

---

**Bottom Line**: Sleeper deliberately doesn't provide projections via their public API. Your app works great with real data - projections would be nice-to-have but aren't necessary for a powerful fantasy tool.
