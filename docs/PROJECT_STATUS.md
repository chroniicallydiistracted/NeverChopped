## ⚠️ What Still Needs Work

### Critical (Must Fix Before "Production Ready")

#### 1. **TypeScript Type Safety** 🔴
**Current State:** Using `any` types extensively (not type-safe)

**What to do:**
- Create `src/types/sleeper.ts` with proper interfaces
- Replace all `any` types with specific types
- Benefits: Better IDE support, catch bugs early

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Complexity:** Medium

---

#### 2. **Error Handling** 🔴
**Current State:** Basic error handling, could crash on API failures

**What to do:**
- Add error boundaries (React component error handling)
- Implement retry logic for failed API calls
- Better user error messages
- Graceful degradation if API is down

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Complexity:** Medium

---

#### 3. **Data Caching** 🟡
**Current State:** Fetches ALL data on every page load (slow!)

**What to do:**
- Cache player data in localStorage (rarely changes)
- Cache league data with 1-hour TTL
- Refresh only matchups during game days
- Benefits: 10x faster load times, less API strain

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Complexity:** Medium

---

### Important (Needed for Great UX)

#### 4. **Settings UI** 🟡
**Current State:** League config hardcoded in file

**What to do:**
- Create settings modal/page
- Allow users to input league ID without editing code
- Support multiple leagues
- Save to localStorage

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Complexity:** Low-Medium

---

#### 5. **Mobile Optimization** 🟡
**Current State:** Looks good on desktop, untested on mobile

**What to do:**
- Test on actual phone/tablet
- Fix any overflow/layout issues
- Optimize touch targets (buttons, tabs)
- Consider bottom navigation for mobile

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Complexity:** Low-Medium

---

#### 6. **Loading States** 🟡
**Current State:** Basic spinner, long initial load

**What to do:**
- Implement progressive loading (show data as it arrives)
- Add skeleton screens
- Show loading progress
- Cache to reduce future loads

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Complexity:** Medium

---

### Nice to Have (Future Enhancements)

#### 7. **Historical Tracking** 🟢
Track performance over time, compare weeks

**Priority:** LOW  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

---

#### 8. **Notifications** 🟢
Push alerts for injuries, trending players

**Priority:** LOW  
**Estimated Time:** 4-8 hours

---

#### 9. **Trade Analyzer** 🟢
Evaluate proposed trades

**Priority:** LOW  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

---

#### 10. **Multiple League Support** 🟢
Track more than one league

**Priority:** LOW  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
