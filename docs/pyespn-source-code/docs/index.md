# Welcome to PyESPN
I am not affiliated with espn, please use this with respect to their infrastructure

## Introduction
The PYESPN python package hits the hidden espn api and pulls sports data

0.3.0 is the first beta version that is useable without potential errors or needing to 
dig thru returned json as the data is now structured in classes

check out the [sports_available](sports_available.md)
